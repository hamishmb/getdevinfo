# getdevinfo

This repository holds my new getdevinfo module. This module was originally integreted directly into the source code of Wine Autostart, DDRescue-GUI, and WxFixBoot, but has now been separated for ease of maintenance. Becae it's here and on PyPI (the Python Package Index) at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/getdevinfo/1.0.0, this means other people can use it too.
