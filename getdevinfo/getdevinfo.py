"""
This is the part of the package that you would normally import and use.
It detects your platform (Linux or macOS), and runs the correct tools
for that platform.

For example (Python 2 or 3):

>>> import getdevinfo
>>> getdevinfo.getdevinfo.get_info()

Or, more consisely:

>>> import getdevinfo.getdevinfo as getdevinfo
>>> getdevinfo.get_info()

Will run the correct tools for your platform and return the collected
disk information as a dictionary.

.. note::
        You can import the submodules directly, but this might result
        in strange behaviour, or not work on your platform if you
        import the wrong one.  That is not how the package is intended
        to be used, except if you want to use the get_block_size()
        function to get a block size, as documented for each platform
        later.

.. module: getdevinfo.py
    :platform: Linux, macOS
    :synopsis: The main part of the GetDevInfo module.

    This function is used to determine the platform you're using
    (Linux or macOS) and run the relevant tools. Then, it returns
    the disk information dictionary to the caller.

    Returns:
        dict, the disk info dictionary.

    Raises:
        Hopefully nothing, but if there is an unhandled error or
        bug elsewhere, there's a small chance it could propagate
